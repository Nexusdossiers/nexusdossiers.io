                    At least one person is dead and more than 10 others injured after an active shooter opened fire at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on McCandlish Road in Grand Blanc, Michigan. The suspect—a 40-year-old male—drove a truck into the church entrance, opened fire with an assault rifle, and set the building ablaze.

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Police responded within minutes and shot and killed the gunman at the scene. Authorities confirm the shooter is deceased and no longer a threat.

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    According to officials at a press conference, hundreds of people were inside the church when the attack began. Rescue crews are still searching the burning structure, and police expect to find additional victims.

                    “This was a targeted attack on Christians,” said former President Donald Trump in a statement. “The FBI is leading the federal investigation. We must end this epidemic of violence and pray for the victims and their families.”
                </blockquote>

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The FBI has taken the lead on the federal investigation, working alongside Michigan State Police and local law enforcement. The motive remains under investigation.

                    Firefighters are battling intense flames as the church continues to burn. Emergency medical teams have transported the wounded to multiple area hospitals. Conditions of the injured are not yet known.
